# knn-algorithm

Using Numpy, I was able to create the K-Nearest Neighbor's algorithm from scratch. This algorithm was tested on the iris dataset, and tested against sci-kit learns version of the KNN algorithm. Results were identical for this dataset. Work was publish on Medium: https://medium.com/can-it-be-predicted/k-nearest-neighbor-classifier-from-scratch-in-python-61c05b4055c
